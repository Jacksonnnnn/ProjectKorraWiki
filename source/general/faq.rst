What is ProjectKorra all about?
-------------------------------

ProjectKorra is an open-source Minecraft Plugin that aims to bridge the Avatar and Minecraft communities. One of our long tern goals is to have a presence on the Modded Minecraft Community, Resource Packs, and more.

Who runs ProjectKorra?
----------------------

Created by MistPhizzle, ProjectKorra would not still be here today if it were not for the community. There is a massive staff team that helps to create the plugins in many ways: plugin and mod development, digital media, server administration and moderation, and more!

How can I get involved with ProjectKorra?
-----------------------------------------

Absolutely anyone can become involved with ProjectKorra. We have many departments that we would love for people to be involved in, such as Development (or Jr. Development), Moderation, Server Building, or Digital Team. Apply by clicking `here <https://projectkorra.com/join-the-team/>`_!

What version does the current version support?
----------------------------------------------

Our current Development Build, ProjectKorra (CORE) v1.8.7, is compatible with 1.12 - 1.12.1 at the moment.

Where can I find development builds of this plugin?
---------------------------------------------------

You can click each plugin name to go to the latest builds: `ProjectKorra(CORE) <https://projectkorra.com/forum/threads/projectkorra-core.13/>`_, `ProjectKorra(RPG) <https://projectkorra.com/forum/threads/projectkorra-rpg.1492/>`_, `ProjectKorra(ITEMS) <https://projectkorra.com/forum/threads/projectkorra-items.1686/>`_, and `ProjectKorra(PROBENDING) <https://projectkorra.com/forum/threads/projectkorra-probending.3893/>`_.

.. note::  Beta Builds are released in increments, they contain smaller versions of the stable releases that we release every 1-2 months. This is done to keep the community interested and to have the public test bugs. These builds are designed to get all of the bugs out before we do our larger releases.

How can I report a bug?
-----------------------

We encourage all bugs, big and small, be reported in the proper bug report section of the forum. Please report all bugs `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/categories/help-and-support.91/>`_. If fixable, all bugs are fixed ASAP. As of ProjectKorra(CORE) v1.5.0, there is a debug feature built into the plugin. This will help us a ton when you submit a bug report if you include the debug.txt created when you use the /bending debug command. This allows us to see what other plugins you have that are interfering with Bending, and any custom plugins. This speeds up the bug fixing process A LOT.

How can I suggest a feature?
----------------------------

As said before, we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for the community, so we absolutely encourage members to suggest features! Suggestions do not have to be based off of something you had seen in the show, rather, they must remain practical. You can make suggestions by clicking `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/forums/suggestions.8/>`_. Please ensure that your suggestion has not been suggested a million other times and it does not already exist.
